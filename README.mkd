##reddit-loadtest
multi-mechanize load tests for open-source reddit installations

Work in progress, with help from Corey Goldberg.

###Running
Requires multi-mechanize.  There's currently two tests:

* reddit - performs r/w load on a particular comment thread with a number of simultaneous logged-in users, including comments, upvotes, and downvotes
* reddit\_read - read-only tests for /all/\* lists

    $ multi-mechanize reddit
    $ multi-mechanize reddit_read
